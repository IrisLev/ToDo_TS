In the test file, write test that clicks :
1. "Active filter"
2. Completed filter
3. Clear Completed
4. Add a new item to a list that has some completed tasks and verify the new one isn't marked as completed or something



STATUS:
Need to finish the test: test('Apply filter "Completed"', async ({}) => {
    And also refactor the previous tests according to the new methods in the Page file
